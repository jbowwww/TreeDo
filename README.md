## TODO 

### General
- Fix remove node action

### JSON / Data
- Refactor JSON load/save code out of App.tsx into /Utility/something

- Allow saving into localStorage
	- maybe make that default but download/upload JSON is called export/import

### GitHub
- Either check privacy settings on your github, to make anything you don't explicitly choose otherwise, to be private (preferred option)
	- or create a new account
- Include this project, and find / retrieve / resurrect / create / steal anything else that would make a good portfolio project
- Create an online resume, link to GitHub & vice versa
- Get at least slightly involved in some other accounts / projects / etc on GitHub

### Future

- Record ideas or future feature plans here

#### React + TypeScript + Vite

This project was created with the VS React & Typescript & Vite tempmlate.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
